# Marvel Rivals - Infinite Swing Utility (Proof-of-Concept)

This repository contains a Rust code snippet demonstrating how to externally modify memory to alter the swing mechanics for swing-based characters in Marvel Rivals.

## What it does

*   **Infinite Swing:** Removes the angle and speed restrictions on swinging for continuous movement.
*   **Flying:** Manipulates gravity and camera force to allow for a basic form of flight, this could be improved upon but I did not find it neccesary.
